# IDCBreastCancer_histopathologyImages_deepResidualLearning
IDC prediction in breast cancer histopathology images using deep residual learning with an accuracy of 99.37% in a subset of images containing a total of 7,500 microscopic images.
# Dataset
The dataset was obtained form kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-idc-in-breast-cancer-histology-images/notebook
The dataset actually contained a total of 277,542 images(198.738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDc positive). Out of the total no of images we used a subset of 7,500 images(3,000 IDc positive and 4,500 IDC negative) to avoid generating memory error.
